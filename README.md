## VirtualPrep

**Inspiration**
As another co-op season is approaching, it is common for students to feel nervous and unready for their interviews. Through this project, we hope to allow individuals to practice their interview skills in a more realistic environment.

**What it does**
VirtualPrep is an interview simulator based on VR. It allows job seekers to practice answering common behavioural interview questions and receive feedback based on the quality and speed of the responses. This simulator increases user engagement and interaction to prepare them for their real job interview.

**How we built it**
Throughout this project, we utilized Unity software to generate scenes and assets for the player. We also used an Oculus to display the virtual reality. We coded all the methods used to create the program in C#. We also used Wit API to implement a text-to-speech integration. This allows users to hear the interviewer say the question.

**Challenges we ran into**
- Speech-to-Text integration: We initially thought of using a particular API but realized that the API was incompatible with the Oculus. Hence, we decided to consider implementing an API as our future implementation.
- ChatGPT integration: We also thought of using a ChatGPT API to generate random questions for the interviewee. As it was a secondary feature, we were not able to integrate it into our system.

**Accomplishments that we're proud of**
As the majority of group members were new to Unity at the start of the hackathon, we had to learn how to navigate through the various functions that the platform provides. After submitting, everyone in the group has a deeper understanding of how to use Unity.

**What we learned**
Our team learned how to use Unity and integrate UI aspects into our project. We also became more familiar with GitHub Desktop to collaborate with each other and push our changes.

**What's next for VirtualPrep**
We hope to integrate a ChatGPT API to generate specific interview questions based on the inputted job position of the user. Moreover, we hope to integrate speech-to-text, so that users can generate a "score" based on their responses to questions.
